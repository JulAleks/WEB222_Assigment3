                  The roots of heavy metal can be traced back to the late 60's. The genre emerged from hard rock, 
                  combining drum and bass rhythm with heavily amplified guitar tune distortion 
                  <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Heavy_metal">(Metal, n.d.)</a> . 
                  The high impact of the aggressive sound, heavy tone, and the distorted riffs together with themed lyrics 
                  breaking social norms allowed bands to connect with the rebellious baby-boomers
                   <a href="https://metalheadcommunity.com/history-of-heavy-metal/">(Ghost, 2019)</a>. 
                  It is hard to pinpoint the first heavy-metal bands as it was a development to become what is known as metal nowadays. 
                </p>
            <p>As rock and blues music advanced more and more musicians would try to break the rules and produces unique sounds. 
              Several pioneers can be traced to the development of what we know today as electric guitar distortion. 
              Musicians like Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix infusing African music with amplified guitars pioneered the way 
              for the blues-rock genre  <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Heavy_metal">(Heavy Metal, n.d.)</a>. 
              Moreover, the guitarist Junior Bernard who played with the blues musician
               Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys were looking for interesting new sounds. Bernard who was knows as an aggressive player 
               tried to push his equipment to it's limits creating dirty unpolished sounds <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/09/brief-history-guitar-distortion-early-experiments-happy-accidents-classic-effects-pedals.html">(Jones, 2018)</a>. Moreover, during those times 
               musicians would use their music as way a protest discussing life problems, government, and religious oppression as the 
               antagonist to the peace and love hippie culture 
               <a href="https://metalheadcommunity.com/history-of-heavy-metal/">(Heavy Metal, n.d.)</a>. 
                Cultivating an environment conducive to the growth 
               of bands Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath the father of metal 
               <a href="https://www.musicianwave.com/history-of-heavy-metal/">(Clark, 2022).</a></p>
              <p>The 1980s in North America marked a significant peak for heavy metal music, with the emergence of glam metal 
                showcasing a more glamorous and flamboyant aesthetic. This shift attracted fans towards a style that embraced a 
                more feminine appearance, deviating from the classic metal with traditional image of rugged and masculine singers prevalent 
                in the 1960s. Featuring musicians like Mötley Crüe, Alice Cooper and Kiss <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Heavy_metal">(Heavy Metal, n.d.)</a>. 
                As North America was developing its music, European bands evolved with it crating new subgenres like black metal. Black 
                metal songs frequently characterized with dark and melancholy feel with ambient noise, quick alternate picking and distorted
                 guitars accompanied with a low-fi production quality. While on the other side of the pendulum Death metal evolved. 
                Despite widespread perception, the subject matter of Death Metal does not revolve around dark themes, rather typically 
                discusses religion, philosophy, politics, and science fiction. As well as other sub genres like Trash Metal and Power Metal
                <a href="https://www.musicianwave.com/history-of-heavy-metal/">(Clark, 2022)</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>The 1990s and the 2000s witnessed the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, marking a significant shift towards
                   alternative music and signaling the decline of classic metal's dominance in the mainstream. Leading away from the classical 
                   rhythm and themes, it was the breakthrough of other metal subcategories as Gothic Metal,
                    Grunge Metal and Nu-Metal to develop. Nu-Metal has achieved mainstream success thanks to extensive 
                    airplay on MTV and the establishment of Ozzy Osbourne's Ozzfest metal music festival in 1996. 
                    This renewed attention from the media sparked discussions about a revival or resurgence of heavy metal. 
                    Deathcore, an extreme metal fusion genre, originated in the 2000s. Deathcore is a hybrid of death metal,
                     hardcore punk, and metalcore. Deathcore is distinguished by death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, 
                     death growls, "pig squeal" vocals, and screaming. In the 2010s, a metal style known as "djent" emerged as 
                     a subgenre of regular progressive metal. Djent music is characterised by rhythmic and technical complexity, 
                     extremely distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs, and polyrhythms, as well as virtuoso soloing. 
                     Another distinguishing feature is the usage of extended range seven, eight, and nine-string guitars <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Heavy_metal">(Heavy Metal, n.d.)</a>. </p>
                  <p>
                    Just like other musical genres, metal culture transcends the boundaries of music. 
                    The clash between mainstream society and metal fans has been a longstanding issue. 
                    Conservative and religious groups believe that metal music and its fans are the abomination against religion 
                    <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Heavy_metal">(Heavy Metal, n.d.)</a>.  
                    Ergo, Metal music is banned from many counties like North Korea, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. 
                     Due to the religious confinement and the fear that the music might bring western feel and will lead fans to stream 
                     away from the religious and strict governmental rules <a href="https://metalinsider.net/lists/countries-where-metal-music-is-illegal">(Yablon, 2019)</a>. The musical culture exerts a significant
                      influence on its fans, including Metalheads and enthusiasts of various subgenres, giving rise to a distinct fashion
                       genre known as alternative. The sense of belonging empowers individuals to challenge societal norms and cultivate
                        their unique identities  <a href="https://metalheadcommunity.com/history-of-heavy-metal/">(Ghost, 2019)</a>.
