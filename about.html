              <h1>Julia Alekseev</h1>
              <p>
                Julia is an aspiring programming student who has a keen interest in blending technicality and art. She possesses a background in Graphic and Interactive Media Design and has previously collaborated with various platforms. However, for the past 10 years, Julia has been actively involved in the healthcare industry after relocating to Canada. During this time, she has dedicated herself to enhancing the oral health of the community, particularly among children, within hospitals and private sectors.

                Presently, Julia is determined to make a comeback to the world of technology and is actively working on improving her programming skills through formal education. Leveraging her expertise in healthcare and nutrition, she aims to bridge the gap between health and technology, seeking collaborative opportunities to develop innovative solutions in these domains. Additionally, Julia has developed a keen interest in cybersecurity and plans to explore this field further to expand her knowledge.

                In her leisure time, Julia takes pleasure in listening to music and cherishing moments with her family and beloved dog. She also has a fondness for horror and cannot resist a good jump scare.

                At the age of 15, Julia discovered her love for metal music, particularly opera metal bands like Nightwish. This profound passion for metal immersed her in its culture and eventually led her to cross paths with a former bass player who shared her love for music. Their mutual connection and shared inspiration brought them together, and they decided to spend the rest of their lives with one another.

                    <p>"I think that our lyrics are definitely dark, but I know for a fact that we pull our inspiration from a million different influences. We listened to everything growing up. Our music isn't just 'opera metal' or 'gothic pop' it's just Evanescence."</p>
